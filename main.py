# Sorry if the code is bad.

# The game is somewhat simple and is explained below.

# 1. The goal.
# The goal is to simply get to the end of the maze, which is a green square.
# The game is endless and there will always be another maze.
#
# 2. Things in the maze.
#     2.1. Powerups.
#         2.1.1. The yellow powerup.
#             It makes you temporarily faster.
#         2.1.2. The cyan powerup.
#             It makes you temporarily slower. It's more like an obstacle.
#
#             Also, they're inspired by the poison mushrooms from
#             Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels.
#
#     2.2. Enemies.
#         Enemies will pick a random direction upon spawning and move in it.
#
#         When an enemy is touched by the player, they will die. However, if
#         the player didn't have a powerup when they touched the enemy, then
#         they will die as well. If the player did have a powerup, then they
#         simply lose it.
#
#         Also, enemies can collect powerups as well and they can even spawn
#         with a powerup equipped.
#
#         There are 2 types of enemies.
#
#         2.2.1. Type 1.
#             These enemies are (usually) dark blue and, when they touch a
#             wall, they will move in the opposite direction.
#         2.2.2. Type 2.
#             These enemies are (usually) purple / violet and, when they
#             touch a wall, they will then move in a random direction.

# The code is divided into 4 main sections.
# Section 1: Defining constants.
# Section 2: Defining classes.
# Section 3: Defining functions.
# Section 4: The gameplay loop (and other stuff).
